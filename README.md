# raw-vca

Eurorack VCA module based in EDU DIY VCA from erica synths and Moritz Klein.

# About the project

This is the second module of the series 'RAW'.

The RAW concept is my way to ease access to the modular world, reducing the cost of the modules to the minimum and removing all unnecessary parts without scarify functionality.

In this case, I took the design of Moritz as a base for this VCA.

# Module overview

## Inputs

- 3 independent VCA.
- offset potentiometer per VCA.

## Calibration

Use the same procedure described for the Moritz VCA. Synth Diy Guy has an awesome video with the entire process.

# Acknowledgments

All design and guts of this module were done by Moritz Klein so I recommend visiting his awesome videos to get a precise idea of how this module works.
